# Battery-Management-System-BMS
Hardware design of an active balancing Battery Management System (BMS) with charge and discharge protection


This repository contains the **hardware design of a Battery Management System (BMS)** for lithium battery packs.

The BMS board provides:
- **Active cell balancing**
- **Charge and discharge protection**
- **Cell voltage and temperature monitoring**
- **Safe operation of multi-cell battery systems**

## Active Cell Balancing
The BMS uses **active balancing** to move energy from high-voltage cells to low-voltage cells instead of wasting it as heat.  
This improves battery efficiency, lifetime, and usable capacity.

## Protection Functions
The system protects the battery pack against:
- Over-voltage and under-voltage  
- Over-current (charge and discharge)  
- Short circuit  
- Over-temperature  

## Project Content
This repository includes:
- Schematic design  
- **PCB layout (in progress)**
